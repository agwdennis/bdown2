The &lsquo;how&rsquo; is very much our focus, the &lsquo;strategy&rsquo;. Strategy matters. It really matters. Although it is the very few at the top that make the decisions, every decision they make decides the fate of millions.</p>
<p>As for the name? <em>Strategoi</em> is the plural of <em>Strategos</em>, meaning &lsquo;Military General&rsquo; in Greek. The aforementioned very few that call the shots, are the modern day <em>Strategoi</em> of humanity. Whether we know their names or not, what they do dictates our futures. It is worth paying attention.</p>
