Welcome to *Our Strategoi*, a site dedicated to understanding what states want, and how they plan to achieve these. The 'how' is very much our focus, the 'strategy'. Strategy matters. It really matters. Although it is the very few at the top that make the decisions, every decision they make decides the fate of millions. 

As for the name? *Strategoi* is the plural of *Strategos*, meaning 'Military General' in Greek. The aforementioned very few that call the shots, are the *Strategoi* of humanity. Whether we know their names or not, what they do dictates our futures. It is worth paying attention.
